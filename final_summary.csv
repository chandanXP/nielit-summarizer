"Besides virtual places and constructions fixed in the virtual world, many other entities, such as objects, user identities, and digital goods, can be exchanged between different virtual worlds and even reflected into the reality world. Besides Meta, some big tech companies have some metaverse investment and development activities, such as Microsoft bought Activision Blizzard, a video game holding company, for $68.7 billion as the deal of gaming expansion into the metaverse. A famous rapper who bought a plot of land in the Sandbox metaverse for $450, 000 is Snoop Dogg, in which this rapper can hold virtual events like music festivals and concerts to bring an immersive experience to the audience participating in the virtual world via the virtual reality technology. the revenue of virtual reality (VR) hardware and in-game advertisement significantly increases through the advancement of virtual activities in the metaverse. the timeline of the metaverse development that involves many primary events, from the birth of the Internet and the first mention in literature to the first virtual world project with Second Life and recent metaverse projects of big tech companies like Microsoft and Facebook. Remarkably, the video game companies and studios have some plans to upgrade existing traditional games to three-dimensional (3D) virtual world convolving social networks, in which some attractive activities, such as live entertainment and media advertising events, can be held besides gaming. Different from the traditional metaverse modality that limits immersive experience poorly by insufficient data, the new one not only generates a huge new source of user and behavioral data for enterprises (where users freely make creative content) but also presents a plentiful foundation to deploy artificial intelligence (AI) into various domains, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and neural interface. Recently, Metaverse Group, a metaverse real estate investment company bought a parcel of land on a decentralized virtual reality platform known as Decentral and for a shocking price $2.43 million and recorded as the highest ever amount for a virtual real estate. At present, the metaverse is defined as a shared virtual 3D world or even multiple cross-platform worlds that can provide users a comprehensively immersive experience with interactive and collaborative activities. With the input data of sensor-based signals collected by multiple devices, such as mobile, smartwatch, and other wearable devices, the complex patterns of human actions can be analyzed and learned for some applications like physical activity recognition that allows a system to perceive user activities and interactions in the virtual world. In the near future, the metaverse will be realized as the next big technology and currently attracting online game makers, internet finance businesses, social networks, and other technology leaders."
"1) Conventional Techniques: Conventional AI/ML algorithms can be grouped based on the kinds of data available for the learning model: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised Learning: The ML algorithms of this learning approach learn the relation between input and output via a mapping function using labeled data. AI for metaverse: This section briefly conveys a wide spectrum of AI, from traditional ML algorithms to advanced DL networks that embrace different learning mechanisms, and then articulates the role of AI in the metaverse. 4 Unsupervised Learning: Unsupervised learning involves the utilization of AI/ML algorithms for unlabeled data analysis and clustering. In semi-supervised learning, an AI model is trained upon the combination of labeled and unlabeled data. Unsupervised learning algorithms can be used for some common tasks of data mining, such as clustering, association, and dimensionality reduction. Semi-supervised Learning: Semi-supervised learning is introduced to partly counter the disadvantages of supervised learning and unsupervised learning (e.g., the limitation of application spectrum). A basic procedure of this type of learning involves two steps: clustering similar data using an unsupervised learning algorithm and then using the existing labeled data to label the remaining unlabeled data. Here we discover some well-known deep architectures, including recurrent neural network (RNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), self-organizing map (SOM), and autoencoders. The highly flexible architectures of DL allow learning systems to process raw data directly and improve learning performance when the data is provided enough. Role of AI in the Metaverse. Self-organizing map: SOM is an unsupervised neural network to find clusters of the input data points by reducing its dimensionality. In the 5G and future 6G systems, many advanced ML algorithms with supervised learning and reinforcement learning have been adopted for different challenging tasks, such as efficient spectrum monitoring, automatic resource allocation, channel estimation, traffic off-loading, attack prevention, and network fault detection. 2) Advanced Techniques: DL, a subset of AI and ML that develops multi-layered artificial neural networks to attain state-of-the-art accuracy in many classification and regression tasks, has been exploited for various applications in multiple domains. Supervised learning algorithms are usually used to handle classification problems and regression problems. Autoencoder: An autoencoder is a special type of neural network, which is trained with the compression and decompression functions to map its input to output. In an autoencoder network, the input layer is encoded into the hidden layer using an encoding function for compression, where the number of hidden nodes is much less than the number of input nodes. Recurrent neural network: RNN is one of the foundational neural network architectures from which various deep architectures, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks, are developed with some structural improvements. Convolutional neural network as one of the most successful deep network architectures, CNN leverages principles from linear algebra (especially matrix multiplication) to identify complex patterns from high-dimensional unstructured data."
"Some fundamental computer vision technologies are potential to enhance the experience of human users in the metaverse, thus enabling users in the physical world to interact with the virtual environment in the digital world smoothly. In conclusion, with ML algorithms and DL architectures, AI is a powerful tool to address many challenging problems of uRLLC in future wireless networks, which allows users to experience high-class integrated services in the metaverse with the guarantee of high throughput low latency. In the last decade, numerous advanced methods for data acquisition, storage, and sharing have been proposed by combining blockchain and AI technologies in various application domains to obtain high data security and privacy, which have shown great potential to be deployed in the metaverse. With a great capability of automatically learning features from high-dimensional unstructured data and effectively dealing with spatiotemporal learning models, DL has been recently applied in DT architectures for different services and applications. For the prediction of userâ€™s eye fixations in some gaze-based applications, such as content design and rendering, a DL framework with multiple CNNs was built to deal with various kinds of input data, e.g., VR image, gaze data, and head data. Federated learning (FL) has recently emerged as an effective solution to address the privacy problems of data sharing, in which multiple users train AI models with their own local data and collaboratively learn a global model at the server by a parameter aggregation mechanism. Compared with VR and AR, MR has more potentials for the metaverse thanks to its hybrid physical-virtual experiences via two main types of devices2 : holographic device with see through display allows users to manipulate physical objects while wearing it and immersive device allows users to interact with virtual objects in the virtual world. Some AI algorithms have been applied in VR devices to improve the human-machine interaction experience based on visual-based information. Some methods proposed innovative networks with advanced CNN architectures and hybrid CNN-RNN architectures to improve learning efficiency of action discrimination models. DL has been further exploited to overcome the learning limitation of conventional ML algorithms and effectively deal with many challenging tasks in NLP. Along with these reality technologies, human users can experience the metaverse and enjoy diversified services in both the physical and digital worlds. 2) Computer vision: In the last decades, computer vision has been empowered by AI, especially DL with a variety of network architectures to improve the overall accuracy of visual systems with efficient cost thanks to high-performance graphic processing units. To access the contents in the metaverse and interact with virtual objects in the digital world, not only AR headsets but also other devices are taken into consideration regarding specific applications, services, and infrastructures. With the VR headset, a human user can experience various services and applications in the metaverse, and further create hyperreal media contents in the virtual world. For the performance investigation of uRLLC services and delay tolerant services in mobile edge computing systems, a DT framework was built in by replicating a virtual pattern of the real network environment. Besides word-aware language models, many character-aware models have been introduced with AI algorithms to deal with various diversified languages in the world. Based on the superiority of capsule network (CapsNet) compared with traditional neural networks in terms of feature extraction and feature explanation, the work applied CapsNet to improve the accuracy of ERP detection in BCI systems. A deep extreme learning machine was exploited in a resource efficient blockchain-based IoT framework, which improved the system security and privacy based on data interpretation and abnormality prediction. Recently, numerous impressive works of image enhancement have achieved considerable performance improvement by exploiting ML algorithms, especially DL with CNN architectures. Accordingly, the experience of users in the metaverse is enhanced significantly with nearly no boundary between the virtual world and the real world. To enhance usersâ€™ quality of experience (QoE) in the virtual world, an innovative human-machine interface approach was proposed by incorporating triboelectric sensory gloves and display components in VR devices to recognize multidimensional motion of gestures. In another work that proposed a cyber-physical framework for smart urban agriculture services and applications, DTs were designed to replicate a virtual representation of farming production, in which the sensory data acquired by practical sensors was processed by ML algorithms in a decision support system. various conventional ML algorithms and innovative DL architectures were investigated for data analytics to detect and classify cyberattacks in blockchain-based networks. In the perspective of image processing and computer vision, these problems are studied over two tasks: image restoration and image enhancement. This framework has shown high performance of fraud detection and threat prediction and can be extended for dealing with security and privacy problems in data storage and sharing instead of data collection. The virtual environment in the metaverse is usually built with diversified visual units therefore, AI-based object detection must deal with a huge number of complicated classes, including real and virtual objects. Numerous recent object detection works have exploited CNN architectures to achieve impressive performance in terms of accuracy and processing speed. In the metaverse, wherein multiple parties join and contribute digital content having different formats and structures, data security, privacy, and interoperability can be fully handled by collaboratively developing blockchain and AI. In the metaverse, NLP techniques should be combined to fully provide text-based, and speech based interactive experiences between human users and virtual assistant. Besides achieving high accuracy of traffic prediction, the deep network showed the effectiveness with different real-world scenarios, such as traffic congestion data and crowd flow data. In the last decade, several innovative technologies have been introduced to improve the overall performance of wireless communication and networking systems, in which AI has been intensively used at multiple layers of a network architecture. FL was applied to address privacy issues in data sharing among multiple untrusted parties in a blockchain network. The AI chatbots are developed to assist users in some virtual environments like the metaverse. In the metaverse, a large amount of data is acquired by VR devices, transmitted over networks, and stored in data centers without any security and privacy protection mechanisms, which can become the sensitive target of cyberattacks. Besides supervised learning, unsupervised and reinforcement learning with deep models have been adopted for some specific NLP tasks, such as text parsing, semantic labeling, context retrieval, language interpretation, and dialogue generation. DTs are at the center of where the physical world and the virtual world interact via IoT connections; and therefore, any change in the real world will be rejected in the digital representation. F. Neural Interface Technology is enriching the world around us by enhancing human experience and fully filling the gap between reality and virtual world in the metaverse. In the future, new devices to enhance the visual-interactive experiences of users in the metaverse should minimize the different gaps in terms of specification and utility between holographic devices and immersive devices. To overcome the high computational cost of conventional channel state information (CSI) estimation approach, an online CSI prediction method was proposed a supervised learning framework by combining CNN and LSTM, in which two-stage training mechanism was deployed to improve the robustness and stableness of CSI estimation in practical 5G wireless systems. While AR provides the experiences of graphics, video streams, and holograms in the physical world and VR offers viewing experiences in a fully immersive digital world, MR can deliver a transition experience between AR and VR. It is noted that the differences in terms of image quality and video specification between the clean virtual contents and real displayed images/videos can appear in VR devices. Besides data security and privacy, interoperability is another important concern in blockchain to collaborate with different parties using different data infrastructures. This section investigates the state-of-the-art AI-based methods in six technical aspects: natural language processing, machine vision, blockchain, networking, DTs, and neural interface, which present the potential for the metaverse. A high-performance method was developed for VR quality assessment by building a 3D CNN architecture, in which the video prediction results are validated via some common image quality assessment metrics without video reference. ML and DL have shown great potential to effectively handle existing challenging tasks, such as intelligent radio resource allocation, in 5G/6G networks while meeting a very low latency. In this context, blockchain with several unique features reveals a promising solution for security and privacy issues in the metaverse, especially when it is empowered by AI technologies. While human pose estimation aims to identify the body parts  and then track them in the real-time environment, action recognition allows systems to understand single actions and complex interactive activities To deal with the problem of estimating human pose in cluttered environments, two discriminative models based on standard structural support vector regression (SVR) and latent structural SVR were studied, which are capable of extracting structural dependencies as the correlations between local features regarding pose representation. Recently, numerous DL-based approaches have shown considerable improvement in terms of performance by exploiting different deep architectures if compared with traditional methods. Compared with the baseline, which performed handcrafted feature extraction and ML algorithms, the 3D CNN-based approach showed superiority in terms of VR video quality assessment and benchmark. To improve the accuracy of body part localization and deal with varying views, the depth information acquired by depth cameras has been learned along with color information by advanced ML and DL models. In the past, many traditional image enhancement methods have been studied by applying image processing techniques, for example, histogram analysis and image decomposition. Inspired by GoogleNet the work proposed EEG-Inception, a novel CNN for EEG-based classification tasks in BCI systems, which involved multiple inception modules in improving feature learning efficiency. In the virtual world, some image quality reduction problems, such as noise, blurring, and low resolution, should be addressed to enrich the visual perception of users. A generic ML framework with domain transformation, feature engineering, and classification was applied to recognize proper welding behaviors based on the data acquired from a bidirectional flow between robot and VR. Indeed, computer vision allows XR devices to analyze and understand user activities based on visual-based meaningful information. Recently, DL has replaced traditional ML in terms of cooperating with blockchain to solve some challenging security and privacy issues of big data, where five essential characteristics of big data are presented. With these distinctive properties, DT is found as one the fundamental building sectors of the metaverse and plays as the gateway for users to enter and enjoy services in the virtual world by creating exact replications of reality, including structure and functionality. For example, DeepChain, a CNN-based blockchain framework, was developed to ensure the privacy and integrity of data contributed by participants in a network. The powerful capability of CNNs in extracting deep visual features at multi-scale image resolutions has been exploited to design advanced segmentation models in. In this context, depth estimation can improve the accuracy of object positioning in the 3D virtual world, but more geometric sensors are required to estimate depth information."
"AI FOR THE METAVERSE: APPLICATION ASPECT


This section conveys the existing AI-aided works in the perspectives of four key applications: healthcare, manufacturing, smart cities, and gaming which are probably considered to delivery specialized services in the metaverse Besides, some other potential applications, including E-commerce, human resources, real estate, and decentralized finance, are discussed in brief. Among different technologies to enable smart cities in the physical world and in the metaverse, AI has shown a great significance to achieve automation and intelligence in smart services. Several smart services, such as utility payment and smart home control, can be now executed in the virtual world via the platforms and systems deployed in the metaverse: intelligent transportation systems (ITS), smart street light management systems, automatic parking systems, smart community portals, and indoor/outdoor video surveillance systems. A. Healthcare
The health industry has recently started exploiting some revolutionary techniques like VR and big data incorporated with AI in software and hardware to increase the proficiency of medical devices, reduce the cost of health services, improve healthcare operations, and expand the reach of medical care.From a 2D environment to a 3D virtual world, the metaverseallows users to learn, understand, and share patientsâ€™ health conditions and medical reports in an immersive manner. Many
scenarios with practical data processing and decision making of different transportation services were investigated simultaneously in both of physical and virtual world, thus conducting high-quality real-time services to users and reducing operation and maintenance costs. By means of VR/XR systems, AI plays a vital role in many healthcare and medical sectors, for example, achieving better efficiency in providing diagnosis, delivering accurate and faster medical decisions, providing better real-time medical imaging and radiology, and supporting more convenient simulated environments to educate interns and medical students.In many wearable devices for healthcare and wellness
applications and services, AI has been applied to automatically recognize complex patterns of sensory data. By using more digital tools and pioneering technologies, smart cities will provide smarter interactive services to users over the metaverse platform. a system of fall detection using wearable devices was proposed for IoT-based healthcare services, in which a hierarchical DL framework with CNN architectures was developed for collaboratively processing sensory data at local devices and a cloud server. Different from digital
transformation to enhance the physical world via digital operations, the metaverse creates a virtual world that is translated onto the physical world based on the foundation of reality interaction and persistence. E. Other Potential Applications
Besides healthcare, manufacturing, smart cities, and gaming,we have found some auxiliary business applications ahead for the metaverse. Currently, AI with ML algorithms and DL architectures have considerably contributed to the manufacturing domain via numerous industrial applications. By integrating DeFi (including basic and professional services) into the metaverse, users can make purchases virtual products identified by NFTs in the digital world, but will receive the real products in the real life. By gathering big data from multiple authenticated sources, many administrative services can be provided and improved in the metaverse thanks to AI technology for data analytics, in which usage rules, ethics, and security will be released to guarantee a safe experience environment. For example, medical students can improve surgical skills by doing interactive practice lessons built for medical education in the virtual world or patients can find some healthcare services via virtual assistants at virtual health centers and hospitals. In a nutshell, AI with traditional ML and innovative DL algorithms have been making an unprecedented revolution of gaming experience in many aspects: improving the intelligence of NPCs, modeling complex systems, making games more beautiful and rational, conducting more realistic human-NPC interactions, reducing cost of in-game world creation, and opening more opportunities of developing mobile games. Indeed, several healthcare and medical services can be provided in the metaverse. With AI in use as the core technology for data analytics, several healthcare and medical diagnosis applications (e.g., motor rehabilitation and magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback) can be developed in the VR environment for multipurpose, such as collaborative treatment planning and educative training . In the effort to develop a hybrid ITS from the physical world to its virtual replication in the digital world, the comprehensive work introduced an intelligent and ubiquitous IoTenabled architecture to control and manage urban traffic. Through virtual entities in the metaverse, the industrial manufacturing efficiency is generally improved with AI to speed up production process design, motivate collaborative product development, reduce operation risk to quality control,and obtain high transparency for producer and customers. For instance, a RNN was developed with an encoderdecoder structure coupled with attention mechanism to predict and diagnose interturn short-circuit faults in permanent magnet synchronous systems.a data-driven LSTMbased fault diagnosis approach was introduced to early detect multiple open-circuit faults in wind turbine systems.a DL-based intelligent fault diagnosis method was introduced to address two challenging problems, i.e., the lack of labeled data for learning model and the data distribution discrepancy between training and testing sets, by incorporating CNN architecture and transfer learning mechanism.Design and implementation of an optimal serial production line are crucial to increase the productivity of the whole manufacturing process. Currently, the actual impact and benefit of these technologies to the smart cities is limited; however, the metaverse can be an accelerant to spread the presentation of smart services in the daily life of citizens. By collaboratively adopting cuttingedge technologies, such as AI and DT, the metaverse for manufacturing can significantly modernize digital operations in the current digital revolution. Therefore, it demands a cooperative AI model to learn complicated patterns from multimodal data for different correlated tasks of manufacturing process and production line, in which the AI model should be equipped with the capability of explanation and reasoning. To build more realistic worlds with attractive challenges and unique stories, video game developers and studios have been increasingly turning to ML as a powerful tool set that help systems and NPCs to respond to playerâ€™s action dynamically and reasonably.the role of artificial and computational intelligence in games has been discussed regarding many research topics: NPC behavior strategy and learning, tactical planning, player response
modeling, procedural content creation, player-NPC interaction design, general game AI, AI-assisted game story telling, and AI in commercial games. In the proposed method, a two-stage transfer learning mechanism was executed with historical data and real-time state data using a deep belief network to solve the nonlinearity of production progress. For in-game decision making and learning, a comprehensive survey investigatedthe use of AI algorithms in intelligent video and computer games. Regarding decision making, some primary AI algorithms (such as decision tree, fuzzy logic, Markov model, rulebased system, and finite-state machine) were deployed for different game developing tasks: modeling game flow, assessing playing motivation, evaluating immersive experience, adapting gameplay, adapting gaming strategy, customizing gameplay, and modeling and controlling NPC behavior. The estate in the metaverse can be used as a virtual place for building constructions (houses and offices) or holding digital events (e.g., art exhibition and fashion show).Moreover, the metaverse is another cost-efficient channel for real estate companies to ultimately show the property to clients before making decision. For supporting physicians and health-wellness experts to make decisions in daily living assistance and early healthy risk
awareness, a physical activity recognition method was introduced by using the sensory data of multiple wearable devices. Manufacturing
As the current wave of industrial revolution, digital transformation in manufacturing has been happening with digital connection between machines and systems to better analyze and understand the physical entities."
"Some attractive metaverse projects, including Decentral and, Sandbox, Realy, Star Atlas, Bit.Country, and DeHealth, which have applied AI to deliver multifarious services and applications in the virtual world, from real estate to E-commerce and real estate. Realy: From the real world to the fully virtual world by creating a unique metaverse ecological world, the Realy metaverse is defined as a super-realistic, futuristic, technologically conscious world, in which E-commerce, social, gaming, and trading are truly integrated to bring a seamless virtual-reality experience to users. Decentral and: This is a decentralized virtual reality platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, in which users can experience, create, and monetize assets, contents, and applications. Sandbox: The Sandbox metaverse is a user-generated decentralized Ethereum blockchain-based virtual world, which allows users and gamers to build, own, and monetize gaming experiences. The landscapes inside the virtual worlds of the projects, for DeHealth, virtual doctors as avatars in the metaverse. Star Atlas: As one of the most recent innovative metaverse projects, Star Atlas introduces a virtual gaming world built on the integration of multiplayer video game platforms, Realtime immersive experiences with 3D rendered visualization, blockchain-based decentralized financial services, and Ai powered game engines. In the virtual world of Realy metaverse, users can enjoy colorful journeys through their personalized avatars with 3D virtual clothes which are available in the marketplace and linked with unique NFTs. DeHealth: Introduced by a British non-profit organization, DeHealth is the worldâ€™s first decentralized healthcare metaverse, which allows doctors and patients to work and interact with each other in a full 3D virtual world. Inspired by Minecraft5, the Sandbox metaverse is first built as a 2D mobile pixel game and then extended to a fully-fledged 3D world with a voxel gaming platform, wherein users can play, sharing, collecting, and trading virtual goods and services without central control. As the primary use cases of SAND in the Sandbox metaverse, the token holders can access and experience the virtual world, vote governance decisions via DAO mechanism, stake tokens to earn revenues, and donate tokens as incentive to developers for the metaverse growth. Besides the blockchain technology with ERC-20 to generate SAND tokens and ERC-1155 for digital assets trading, AI has been utilized in the Sandbox metaverse. Being more than a virtual world, Bit.Country can connect some virtual aspects to the real world to obtain a sustainable future instead of joyful immersive experience. Some virtual hospitals and healthcare centers can be built to provide virtual services with real data and diagnosis results. Different from traditional virtual worlds and social networks, Decentral and is not controlled by any centralized organization; that is, no single agent has a permission to modify the rules of software, content, economic of cryptocurrency, or prevent others from accessing the world, trading digital products, and experienced services."
"Investigation on the role of AI in the foundation of the metaverse and its potential to enhance user immersive experience in the virtual world. Metaverse developers, virtual world designers, and users cannot completely understand AI decision-making processes (e.g., how and why an AI model delivers a prediction), and probably trust them blindly. With XAI, system engineers and data scientists who apply AI in the metaverse (from system infrastructure to services and applications in the virtual worlds) can understand and explain what exactly is happening inside an AI model, how is a specific result generated by an AI algorithm, and when is a prediction model likely to crash. At the beginning of this work, the fundamental concepts of the metaverse and AI techniques were provided, along with the role of AI in the metaverse. Finally, we have examined prominent metaverse projects, in which AI techniques were used to sharpen the quality of services and encompass the ecosystem of the metaverse. Besides increasing end user 20 confidence, model auditability, and operative efficiency, XAI mitigates legal risks and security threats of production AI in the metaverse while guaranteeing usersâ€™ reliable experience."
